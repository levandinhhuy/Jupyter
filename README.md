# Python & Machine Learning Practice Repository

Welcome to my learning repository! 🎓

This is a space where I explore and practice coding in **Python**, and experiment with implementing **simple machine learning programs**. The goal is to build a solid foundation in programming and understand the basics of machine learning through hands-on examples.

## What you'll find here

- 🐍 Python scripts for learning syntax, data structures, and algorithms
- 🤖 Introductory machine learning models using libraries like `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`
- 📊 Projects involving data preprocessing, classification, regression, and visualization
- 📝 Notes and documentation to track my learning journey

## Why this repo?

I'm using this repository to:
- Practice writing clean and efficient Python code
- Understand core ML concepts by building small projects
- Document my progress and share what I learn

Feel free to explore, suggest improvements, or fork the repo if you're on a similar learning path!
